# Design additions

## Addition of nav bar under card carousel on desktop

![footer-image](./static/footer.png)

The right and left arrows were added as I felt it helped the user instead of using the mouse to change. On mobile they are removed as swipe gesture is easy

# Incomplete work

## Scrolling behavior mobile

According to design the top part should go behind the scrollable content. I got it working on branch [task/sticky-header](https://github.com/Sidhanthsur/debit-card/tree/task/sticky-header) You can switch branch and test it too.

Could not complete as desktop styling needed a bit more time

## Unit test case

Had time to finish few sanity test on basic components and testing button functionalities.
